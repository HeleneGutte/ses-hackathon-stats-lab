## Get Data and Libraries

We will use data from the [`palmerpenguins`](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) package for the first few sections.

```{r get data}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
```

## Introducing the dataset

## Framing a research question

## Preliminary data exploration

Following teh steps outlined in Chapter 18 (`SES Probelmes and Questions`):

- Identifying key features (mean, variance, normality/distribution of the data)
- Comparison between different categories
- Relations between features
- Which places or groups have similar characteristics (multivariate analysis)
- How do features change across years (time series analysis)
